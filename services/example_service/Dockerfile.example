WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements file and install dependencies
# Note: Make sure your requirements.txt includes all necessary packages
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# For production, you might want to be more selective about what gets copied
COPY . .

# Set environment variables
# These can be overridden at runtime if needed
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app
ENV API_HOST=0.0.0.0
ENV API_PORT=8000

# Make the entrypoint script executable
RUN chmod +x /app/services/example_service/entrypoint.sh

# Expose the port the API will run on
EXPOSE 8000
