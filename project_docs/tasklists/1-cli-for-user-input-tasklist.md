# Milestone 1: CLI for User Input

*Implement a command-line interface (CLI) to accept a user's text prompt, as detailed in FR1.1 and TR1.3. This will serve as the entry point for invoking the workflow.*

- [ ] 1 [TASK][Research CLI library]
    Research and choose a suitable Python library for building the CLI (e.g., `argparse`, `click`, `typer`).
- [ ] 2 [TASK][Design CLI command]
    Design the CLI command structure and arguments for accepting a user prompt.
- [ ] 3 [FUNCTION][`main`]
    The main entry point for the CLI. It will parse arguments and pass the prompt to the core workflow.
- [ ] 4 [TASK][Implement CLI]
    Implement the basic CLI to capture user input and call a placeholder for the workflow.
- [ ] 5 [TASK][Write unit tests]
    Write unit tests to ensure the CLI is capturing input correctly.
- [ ] 6 [TASK][Document CLI usage]
    Document the CLI usage in a README or help text.
