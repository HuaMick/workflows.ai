# Milestone 5: Basic Server Implementation

*Create a basic server to host and execute the LangGraph graph, enabling the system to run as a server-based application (FR1.6, US3).*

- [ ] 1 [TASK][Research web framework]
    Research and choose a lightweight Python web framework (e.g., `FastAPI`, `Flask`).
- [ ] 2 [TASK][Implement server]
    Set up the basic server application.
-   [ ] 2.1 [FUNCTION][`invoke_workflow`]
        An API endpoint (e.g., `/invoke`) that accepts a POST request with the user prompt. This will call the compiled LangGraph app.
        - **Parameters:** A request body containing the `prompt` string.
        - **Returns:** A JSON response indicating success or failure.
-   [ ] 2.2 [TASK][Write API tests]
        Write integration tests for the `/invoke` endpoint to validate success and error scenarios.
- [ ] 3 [TASK][Containerize application]
    Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the server application for deployment.
