# AI-Powered QA Agent (Proof of Concept) Task List

This document breaks down the development of the AI-Powered QA Agent into milestones, nodes, and functions, leveraging FastMCP for the server implementation.

## Functions

- **define_fastmcp_server**
  - description: Defines the FastMCP server instance and registers tools.
- **run_qa_workflow**
  - description: A tool that finds, parses, and executes the QA workflow from `qa-workflow.md`. This is the main entry point for the QA process.
- **find_workflow_file**
  - description: Searches for the `qa-workflow.md` file in the project root.
  - parameters: `root_path`
  - returns: `file_path` or `null`
- **parse_workflow_file**
  - description: Parses the markdown `qa-workflow.md` file into a list of executable tasks.
  - parameters: `file_path`
  - returns: `list_of_tasks`
- **execute_qa_task**
  - description: Executes a single, predefined QA task.
  - parameters: `task`

## Milestones

- [ ] **Milestone 1: FastMCP Server Foundation**
  - [ ] **Task:** Setup the basic scaffolding for the FastMCP server.
  - [ ] **Node:** `mcp_server_node` - Manages the definition of the FastMCP server.
    - [ ] `define_fastmcp_server`

- [ ] **Milestone 2: QA Workflow Tool**
  - [ ] **Task:** Implement the core logic of the QA agent as a single tool.
  - [ ] **Node:** `qa_workflow_node` - Orchestrates the QA workflow.
    - [ ] `run_qa_workflow` (tool):
      - [ ] Use `find_workflow_file` to locate `qa-workflow.md`.
      - [ ] Use `parse_workflow_file` to extract tasks.
      - [ ] For each task, call `execute_qa_task`.
    - [ ] `find_workflow_file` (helper function)
    - [ ] `parse_workflow_file` (helper function)
    - [ ] `execute_qa_task` (helper function)

> ⚠️ **TBC:** The PRD mentions that the trigger mechanism is a key design decision. With FastMCP, this is simplified to calling the `run_qa_workflow` tool. We need to confirm this aligns with the overall architecture.
