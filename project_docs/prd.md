# Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI-Powered Workflow Automation System

## Initial description of the product

This project aims to build a customizable, AI-powered workflow automation system to overcome the limitations of existing AI coding assistants. The goal is to create a more powerful and flexible development environment. The proposed solution is a multi-agent system using LangGraph, with a command-line interface (CLI) for interaction. The initial MVP will focus on a basic workflow: accepting a prompt via CLI, sending it to the Gemini API, and writing the response to a markdown file.

## Assumptions

*   The user has a Google Cloud project with the Gemini API enabled.
*   API key management for the Gemini API is handled by the user.
*   The CLI will be developed using a standard Python library like `click` or `argparse`.

## Goals

*   **G1:** Increase AI coding capabilities and productivity.
*   **G2:** Create a flexible and extensible platform for AI-assisted development.
*   **G3:** Overcome the limitations of existing AI coding assistants.

## User Stories

*   **US1 (Developer):** As a developer, I want to provide a prompt to the system via a CLI so that I can get a response from an AI model.
*   **US2 (Developer):** As a developer, I want the AI's response to be saved to a file so that I can easily review and use it later.
*   **US3 (System Operator):** As a system operator, I want to run the workflow system as a server-based application to enable continuous operation and future multi-user support.

## Functional Requirements

*   **FR1.1:** The system must provide a CLI to accept a user's text prompt.
*   **FR1.2:** The system must send the received prompt to the Gemini API.
*   **FR1.3:** The system must handle the response from the Gemini API.
*   **FR1.4:** The system must save the Gemini API response into a new markdown file in the project's root directory.
    > ⚠️ **TBC:** What should the naming convention be for the output markdown file? For now, it will be `response.md`.
*   **FR1.5:** The core logic must be implemented as a LangGraph graph.
*   **FR1.6:** A basic server must be implemented to host and execute the LangGraph graph.

## Technical Requirements

*   **TR1.1:** The multi-agent system must be built using the LangGraph framework.
*   **TR1.2:** The system must integrate with the Google Gemini API for its generative AI capabilities.
*   **TR1.3:** The primary user interaction will be through a Command-Line Interface (CLI).

## Out of Scope

*   Advanced workflow customization and configuration.
*   Agent context management.
*   Job scheduling and automation features.
*   Support for any other AI models besides Gemini.
*   A graphical user interface (GUI).

## High level design choices

*   The initial version of the system will be a CLI application.
*   The server component will be a basic implementation sufficient to run the initial LangGraph workflow.
