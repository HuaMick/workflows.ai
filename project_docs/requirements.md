# Project: AI-Powered Workflow Automation System

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a customizable, AI-powered workflow automation system. The project is motivated by the need to overcome the limitations of existing AI coding assistants and to create a more powerful and flexible development environment.

## 2. Problem Statement

As a senior data engineer, I have encountered limitations with current AI coding assistants. The primary frustrations stem from the inability to:

*   Customize agent workflows.
*   Configure the context provided to the agent.
*   Schedule and automate agent jobs.

This lack of control hinders productivity and limits the potential of AI-assisted development for complex engineering tasks.

## 3. Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is to develop a multi-agent system using LangGraph. This system will provide a flexible and extensible platform for creating and managing custom AI agent workflows. Interaction with the system will be facilitated through a command-line interface (CLI), allowing for seamless integration into existing development environments.

The development will start with a minimal viable product (MVP) focusing on a basic LangGraph server, which will be incrementally enhanced with more complex workflows and features. The initial workflow will:

1. Accept a user prompt via CLI
2. Send the prompt to Gemini API
3. Receive the response from Gemini
4. Write the response to a markdown file in the project root directory

This simple workflow will serve as a foundation for more complex agent interactions in future iterations.

## 4. Key Requirements

### 4.1. Core System

*   **Multi-Agent Framework:** Implement a multi-agent system using LangGraph.
*   **LangGraph Server:** Set up a basic server to host and execute the agent graphs.
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Develop a CLI for interacting with the multi-agent system.

### 4.2. Initial Features (MVP)

*   A minimal LangGraph server implementation.
*   A simple workflow that can be triggered from the CLI.
*   The ability to extend the system with new workflows.

### 4.3. Future Enhancements

*   Workflow customization and configuration.
*   Context management for agents.
*   Job scheduling and automation.

## 5. Goals

*   Increase AI coding capabilities and productivity.
*   Create a flexible and extensible platform for AI-assisted development.
*   Overcome the limitations of existing AI coding assistants.
