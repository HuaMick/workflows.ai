# AI-Powered QA Agent (Proof of Concept)

This document outlines the requirements for a Proof of Concept (POC) of an MCP server that can trigger a background QA agent after each interaction with the primary AI assistant.

## 1. Core Feature: Post-Interaction QA

**Goal:** An MCP server that can trigger a QA agent in the background.

**User Stories:**

*   As a developer and cursor user, I want to be able to define a workflow in a markdown file that will get triggered after each agent call.

**Functional Requirements:**

*   The system must discover a specific QA workflow file (e.g., `qa-workflow.md`) within the project root.
*   The MCP server must expose a tool or mechanism that the AI assistant can call upon completion of its tasks.
*   The server will then execute the QA workflow defined in the markdown file.
*   As a POC the the QA agent will execute predefined tasks that don't require context from the primary AI assistant.
    *   For example, tasks like "review file xyz" will be defined in the workflow file.

## 2. Technical Approach & Architecture

The proposed architecture is to build this system as a custom **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that integrates with the Cursor IDE. This allows the QA agent to be triggered automatically and to access the necessary context from the IDE.

### Key Architectural Components:

*   **MCP Server:** The core of the system, running as a persistent process. It will listen for a signal to trigger the QA workflow.
*   **Workflow Parser:** A simple component to parse the `qa-workflow.md` file and translate its contents into executable actions for the LLM.

### Implementation Considerations:

*   **Trigger Mechanism:** A key design decision is how the primary agent signals the MCP server. This could be an explicit tool call at the end of its response or a hook that detects when the agent is finished.
*   **Workflow Definition:** The `qa-workflow.md` file will contain the instructions for the QA agent. The format should be simple, human-readable markdown that the parser can easily interpret.

## 3. Out of Scope

*   **Complex, multi-step workflows:** The initial version will not support persistent, stateful workflows with advanced features like automatic retries or complex dependency chains. The focus is on a single, post-interaction QA task.
*   **Prompt engineering analytics:** The system will not log detailed prompt/response data for performance analysis or provide a diagnostics interface.
*   **Scheduled or recurring tasks:** The QA workflow will only be triggered after an agent interaction, not on a time-based schedule.
*   **Dynamic Context Passing:** For this POC, the QA agent will execute predefined tasks and will not receive dynamic context (e.g., file diffs or state snapshots) from the primary agent's actions. This advanced capability, as detailed in the research on context passing, is a goal for future iterations.
