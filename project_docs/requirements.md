I'm senior data engineer and have hit a ceiling with cursor. 
I'm fustrated with not being able to customize the agent workflow, configure context or schedule agent jobs. 

My Research has showed, engineers that reach this point typically:
- leveraging Langgraph to setup a multiAgent system is the next evolution. 
- engineers use a command line interface to interact with the multiAgent system that they build


The goal is to further increase my AI coding capabilities and productivity.
